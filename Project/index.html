                Despite their small size, pugs are known for their big personalities. They are often described as "clowns" due to their humorous and mischievous behavior. Pugs are also quite affectionate and enjoy being the center of attention.

                Pugs are generally good with children and get along well with other pets. However, they can be prone to certain health issues, such as obesity and breathing problems, so it's important to provide them with proper care, exercise, and a balanced diet.
